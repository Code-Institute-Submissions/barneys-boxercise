I am creating a website about my local Boxercise class which is called Barney’s Boxercise. In this website I will have a Home Page, Gallery Page and Sign Up page.  Every page on the website will have the same header and footer for easy navigation. The main principle of the website is to get more people to attend the fitness class by completing the form on the sign up page.
This website will most likely be visited by people who have heard of the class through social media or word of mouth and are interested in signing up. Also a lot of people would want to see the class first before committing to anything so I feel the gallery page will attract a lot of people to the class.

Header
On the header I will have a navigation link so the user can switch between each page with the click of the link. I will also have a logo of the class to make the site and class look more professional.
This header will appear on all 3 pages of the website and is where the user will see logo and navigate to the other pages. The user’s goal is to be able to switch between pages whenever they want and this is where they can do it by left clicking the page title. The user will find the information they want to see by entering the different pages.

## Footer
On the footer I will have the location, timetable of the classes, price and links to any social media accounts associated with the class.
This footer will appear on all 3 pages of the website and is where see important information of the class and social media links. The user’s goal is to be able to see the most common information that the user will want to find out about. I will have it appearing on every page of the website so the user can see it in every page they visit so it stops them from having to go back and forward between pages to access this information. The user will find the information they want to see by entering the different pages.

Home Page
The Home page will give a bit of background on what the boxercise class is all about.  I will have a picture at the top of the page spread across the entire width of the page so it stands out. I will have the picture change when user hovers over it. Below that I will have a paragraph with a bit of background of the class. I will also have a list on what all activities will be featured in the class with an icon beside each one. 
This page is where the user will find out the information on the class. The user’s goal when they first enter the website is to find out what the class is about, location, times and price. The user will find all the information they need as soon as they enter the website.

I have attached a PDF of the Home Page mockup to the project’s GitHub. The file is called ‘Storyboards (Barney's Boxercise) - Home Page’.

Gallery
The Gallery page is where the user can see images of previous classes so they can see what an actual class looks likes. I will have a gallery where the user will click on the image and it will make it bigger so they can have a better view. Then they can exit the image to bring them back to the main page. I will have a between 15 to 50 images on this page.
This page is where the user will want to find out what the class and people look like who is taking part in the class. The user’s goal when they click on the link to this page is to see pictures and make it easy to navigate between each one. The user will find all the images for the class on this page and will be updated regularly as the class progresses.

I have attached a PDF of the Gallery page mockup to the project’s GitHub. The file is called ‘Storyboards (Barney's Boxercise) - Gallery’.

Sign Up
The Sign Up page is where new members will be able to send their information to let us know that they are interested in joining the class. The page will consist of a form with heading and text boxes which will be:
•	Name
•	Address
•	Telephone Number
•	E-mail Address
•	Date of Birth
•	How did you hear about us? (Check boxes)
•	Preferred class time (Drop down box with 3 choices)
•	Other information e.g. medial conditions
I will also have a Submit button so they can submit there information and will display a message letting them know that it has been sent successfully.
This page is where the user will sign up to the class if they are interested in taking part in the class. The user’s goal is to type in there details and make sure they are signed up to be able to attend the classes in which they want. The user will have basic information to fill out and if they fill out something wrong or leave blank they will be notified of this. Once the user fills out all fields and clicks the ‘Submit’ button then they will be notified that it has been entered successfully and will be able to attend the next class.

I have attached a PDF of the Sign Up page mockup to the project’s GitHub. The file is called ‘Storyboards (Barney's Boxercise) – Sign Up’.

This website will be aimed at both men and women from the ages of around 15-50. It will suit people around the area as I know most towns how some sort of gym or fitness class. I will keep the website simple and colourful as I am trying to attract a younger audience. I know that not everyone is good on computers that may want to attend the class so I will make it as user friendly and easy to use as possible.
